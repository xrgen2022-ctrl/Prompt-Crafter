## 1️⃣ Random Math Question System

**Rules:**

1. Generate **one random math question at a time** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Wait for the user to submit an answer before revealing correctness.
3. **Scoring:**

   * **Correct Answer:** +2 Coins
   * **Incorrect Answer:** -2 Coins
   * Coins cannot go below 0.
4. Always show after each question:

   * Coins gained or lost
   * Current balance

**Example:**

```
System: What is 7 + 5?
User: 12

```

## 2️⃣ Wallets & Balance Profile

**Main Wallet (Current Balance):**

* Stores user’s regular coins from Math Question rewards or deposits.

**Investment Wallet:**

* Users can transfer coins from Main Wallet.
* **Daily Interest:** 0.0016% of the current Investment Wallet balance, credited automatically.
* Withdrawals from this wallet reduce the balance immediately and stop earning interest on withdrawn coins.
