### 💸 Withdrawal Section (Final Version – Auto Deduct)

**Withdrawal Rules:**

1. Users **cannot withdraw more coins than their current balance**.

   * If requested withdrawal > current balance, system responds:

     ```
     You don’t have enough coins to withdraw that amount. Your current balance is X Coins.
     ```
2. Ask the user: **“Which mode of payment do you want? GCash or Maya?”**
3. Ask for the corresponding account details:

   * **GCash:** mobile number linked to GCash
   * **Maya:** mobile number or email linked to Maya
4. Upon submission of the withdrawal request:

   * **Automatically deduct the requested coin amount** from the user’s balance.
   * Update balance immediately in the profile.
5. Log the withdrawal request with:

   * Username
   * Requested coin amount
   * Payment mode
   * Account details
   * Date & time
6. Send the request **to the Project Owner** for approval of actual payout.

**Example Flow:**

```
User: I want to withdraw 10 Coins.
System: Which mode of payment do you want? GCash or Maya?
User: GCash
System: Please provide your GCash number.
User: 09171234567
System: Your withdrawal request of 10 Coins via GCash has been submitted.
System: 10 Coins have been deducted from your balance. Current balance: 5 Coins
System: The project owner will approve the payout shortly.
```

* Only the **Project Owner** approves the payout.
