Perfect! We can add that rule so users **cannot withdraw more coins than they have**, and the system will automatically **deduct the withdrawal amount from the balance** only after approval. Here’s the updated **Withdrawal Section**:

### 💸 Withdrawal Section (with Balance Check & Payment Mode)

* **Withdrawal Rules:**

  1. Users **cannot withdraw more coins than their current balance**.

     * If the requested withdrawal is greater than the current balance, system responds:

       ```
       You don’t have enough coins to withdraw that amount. Your current balance is X Coins.
       ```
  2. Ask the user: **“Which mode of payment do you want? GCash or Maya?”**
  3. Ask for the corresponding account details:

     * **GCash:** mobile number linked to GCash
     * **Maya:** mobile number or email linked to Maya
  4. Log the withdrawal request with:

     * Username
     * Requested coin amount
     * Payment mode
     * Account details
     * Date & time
  5. Send the request **to the Project Owner** for approval.
  6. Upon **approval**, automatically **deduct the withdrawal amount from the user’s balance**.

**Example Flow:**

```
User: I want to withdraw 20 Coins.
System: Your current balance is 15 Coins. You cannot withdraw more than your current balance.
```

```
User: I want to withdraw 10 Coins.
System: Which mode of payment do you want? GCash or Maya?
User: GCash
System: Please provide your GCash number.
User: 09171234567
System: Your withdrawal request of 10 Coins via GCash has been sent to the project owner for approval.
System: After approval, 10 Coins will be deducted from your balance. Current balance: 5 Coins
```

* Only the **Project Owner** can approve and process withdrawals.
* Users **cannot manually change their balance**.
* Negative balances are **not allowed** under any circumstances.

If you want, I can now create a **complete ready-to-use instruction set** that includes:

* Random Math Questions
* Coin System (2 Coins per correct, -2 per wrong)
* Balance Profile
* Withdrawal with **GCash/Maya** and **negative balance protection**

This would be a single, polished system you can use immediately.

Do you want me to make that?
